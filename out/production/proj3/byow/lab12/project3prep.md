# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
I thought more horizontally/rows in my implementation of tessellating hexagons. The lab
implementation did it in columns which showed me that there is more than one way to
implement this.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: as you walk down the hallway, go into equal distance rooms and do
the same amount of work as the other rooms.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would do a position instructor. Less specifically, I would build a 
constructor that uses recursion to build a desirable hexagon.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: If im understanding the idea of hallways and rooms correctly,
 I would say the hallway is more about how to get in position to do the
 next task. While on the other hand the room is where the task takes place.
